# Louise Eriksson Portfolio

This is my portfolio. 
It is a personal project where I've built this website using React.js, aiming to serve as a presentation and representation of myself as both a person and a frontend developer. 
In this project, I've experimented with various design features and animations using CSS.Modules.
